# Movie Ratings Analysis

This project analyzes a movie ratings dataset using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and SQLite to explore viewer preferences and trends over time. The analysis begins by loading and storing movie and rating data into a SQLite database, followed by executing SQL queries to extract top-rated movies, most active users, genre distributions, and rating statistics. Further exploration is performed by merging datasets and extracting features like release year and rating year. Data is cleaned and transformed, including exploding multi-genre movies for detailed genre-wise insights. A variety of visualizations are created—bar plots, count plots, line charts, and heatmaps—to show rating distributions, trends over years, average ratings by genre and release year, genre popularity over time, and the most and least liked movies with sufficient ratings. This project helps uncover patterns in audience behavior and preferences across genres, years, and individual films.
